import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can deploy a [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) site on AWS in a few minutes with Thunder. Your site is served over a lightning-fast global CDN, comes with fully managed TLS certificates, and supports custom domains out of the box.

The server pre-rendered pages produced by the build step will be stored in an S3 bucket and served using CloudFront CDN.

## Build Settings

Use the following commands in the build step settings:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
```sh title="Install command"
npm install
```
```sh title="Build command"
npm run docs:build
```
```sh title="Output directory"
docs/.vitepress/dist
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
```sh title="Install command"
npx pnpm install
```
```sh title="Build command"
npx pnpm run docs:build
```
```sh title="Output directory"
docs/.vitepress/dist
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
```sh title="Install command"
npx bun install
```
```sh title="Build command"
npx bun run docs:build
```
```sh title="Output directory"
docs/.vitepress/dist
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That’s it! Your app will be live on your CloudFront URL as soon as the build finishes.


## Environment Variables

Environment variables in VitePress are available at build time and can be used both in your config files and templates. For more information, refer to the official [Vite documentation on environment variables](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables).

You can define them in an .env file at the root of your project:


```sh title=".env"
VITE_APP_NAME=test
```

Access the variable in your VitePress config:

```ts title="docs/.vitepress/config.mts"
export default async ({ mode }) => {
  const env = loadEnv(mode || '', process.cwd())

  const name = env.VITE_APP_NAME;

  return defineConfig({ 
    title: name,
    /** */ 
  })
}

```

Use it in your templates:

```mdx title="docs/index.md"
<script setup>
const name = import.meta.env.VITE_APP_NAME;
</script>

# {{ name }}

```
