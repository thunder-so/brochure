Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. In this guide, we will cover how to create a new Vite project and prepare it for deployment on AWS.

## Creating a New Vite Project

To create a new Vite project, you can use npm, pnpm, or bun. Here are the commands you need:

```sh title="Create Vite project"
npm create vite@latest my-vite-project
cd my-vite-project
npm install
```

## Build Settings for Deployment

Use the following build settings:

Your app will be ready for deployment on your CloudFront URL as soon as the build completes.

## Environment Variables
You can configure environment variables in Vite at build time by adding them in an .env file at your project's root:

```sh title=".env"
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Use it in your application:

```js title="src/main.js"
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

console.log(`API URL: ${apiUrl}`);
```

With these instructions, you are well-equipped to create a Vite project and deploy it on AWS efficiently.
