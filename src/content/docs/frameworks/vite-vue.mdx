You can deploy a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) site with Vue 3 on AWS with Thunder. The server pre-rendered pages produced by the build step will be stored in an S3 bucket and served using CloudFront CDN.

## Build Settings

Use the following commands in the build step settings:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
```sh title="Install command"
npm install
```
```sh title="Build command"
npm run build
```
```sh title="Output directory"
public
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
```sh title="Install command"
npx pnpm install
```
```sh title="Build command"
npx pnpm run build
```
```sh title="Output directory"
public
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun" icon="bun">
```sh title="Install command"
npx bun install
```
```sh title="Build command"
npx bun run build
```
```sh title="Output directory"
public
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That’s it! Your app will be live on your CloudFront URL as soon as the build finishes.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables in Vite are available at build time and can be used both in your config files and templates. For more information, refer to the official [Vite documentation on environment variables](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables).

You can define them in an .env file at the root of your project:


```sh title=".env"
VITE_BASE_URL=https://thunder.so
```

Use it in your templates:

```vue 
<script setup lang="ts">
const url = import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL;
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <a :href=url target="_blank">Thunder</a>
</template>
```
