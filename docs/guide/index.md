# Getting Started with Thunder

Thunder is a lightning-fast deployment platform designed specifically for Node.js developers and web application teams. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of getting started with Thunder.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

  - A Github account
  - An AWS account (root or IAM access)
  - A Node.js application in your Github (optional)

## Sign up for Thunder

To get started with Thunder, sign up for an account using your Github account on [Thunder Cloud](https://cloud.thunder.so). Once you've signed up, you'll be taken to the dashboard.

## Create a Workspace

A workspace is a logical grouping of Applications, Teams and Billing. 

To create a workspace, click on the "Create Workspace" button on the left sidebar.

## Connect AWS Account

After you have created a Workspace, you need to connect your AWS account. In the Thunder workspace, click on "AWS Connections" in the sidebar section, and follow the steps to connect your AWS account.

## Create an Application

Once you've created a workspace and connected your AWS account, you can create an application. Click on "New Application" button.

You can now select your Node.js application from your Github account and choose the AWS region where you want to deploy it.

## Preview and Deploy

With Thunder, you can trigger preview deployments with a `git push` to your GitHub repository.

Congratulations! You've now successfully deployed your Node.js application on your AWS with Thunder Cloud.
