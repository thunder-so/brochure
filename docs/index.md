    <blockquote>"Open source web application frameworks should be easier to run on the cloud."</blockquote>
    <p>I arrived at that statement after attempting to install a well-known open source framework (Next JS) on AWS.</p>
    <p>Having spent 40+ hours with AWS Amplify, S3, CloudFront, CloudFormation, Lambda, I failed. Picked up the project again a few months later and spent another 40+ hours to crack it.</p>
    <p>Looked into companies that offers this as a service. Just wanted the usability of Heroku/Vercel wrapped around AWS. Found nothing.</p>
    <p>Why not build it, then? Hence, we spent six months working 12 hour days and produced something that might be valuable to the world. We can now deploy our favourite JavaScript framework on our own AWS account with ease.</p>
    <p>If you find value in this product, consider becoming an early adopter.</p>
